# Hello_EmbeddedLinuxDrivers
 Embedded Linux Drivers Done by me during my study of Embedded Linux Drivers  as exercise. The drivers are done on a raspberry pi 3 model B
1- GPIO driver has a make that will identify your arch and build accordingly
   it also has a bash script that will automate the insertion and removal of the driver and to test the driver is build , inserted and working
   finally the driver has an application level code in cpp that will read pin GPIO3 and write to GPIO2 the state of GPIO3 and output the current state of the pin in the terminal
